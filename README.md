## Philosophy

@wundertax/utm-persist provides an easy wrapper solution to deal with UTM parameters that need to be persisted and sent to a backend server.

## Installation

> Note: The `master` branch of the repository reflects ongoing development. Releases are published as [tags](https://github.com/wundertax/utm-persist/releases).
>
> You should never blindly install from `master`, but rather check what the available stable releases are.
